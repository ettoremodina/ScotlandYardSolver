### Fallback Options
If FFmpeg is not available, the system will automatically try:
1. **Matplotlib Animation**: Creates GIF files
2. **Image Sequence**: Creates a ZIP file with individual frame images

### Python Dependencies
All required packages are already included in the project:
- `matplotlib` (for graphics)
- `networkx` (for graph layout)

## Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Export with default settings (1 second per step)
python export_video.py saved_games/games/game_20250719_175113.pkl
```

### Custom Settings
```bash
# Slow, detailed replay
python export_video.py saved_games/games/game_20250719_175113.pkl \
    --duration 3.0 \
    --output detailed_replay.mp4

# Fast summary
python export_video.py saved_games/games/game_20250719_175113.pkl \
    --duration 0.3 \
    --output quick_summary.mp4
```

## Output
